# Memory-Partitioning-and-Process-Scheduling-in-Python
memory management with fixed partition technique in two single queue and multiple queue method.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of memory partitioning and process scheduling. The code demonstrates two methods for allocating processes to memory partitions: single queue and multiple queue. By using threading and queues, the code efficiently manages process allocation and deallocation, aiming to optimize memory utilization and throughput.

## Features

- **Dynamic Memory Partitioning**: The memory is partitioned dynamically based on the given size.
- **Process Scheduling**: Two methods of scheduling (single queue and multiple queue) are implemented.
- **Threading**: Utilizes Python's `threading` module to handle process allocation and deallocation concurrently.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates memory utilization and throughput for both scheduling methods.
- **Colorful Output**: Uses the `colorama` library to enhance console output for better readability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `colorama` library

You can install the `colorama` library using pip:
```bash
pip install colorama
```
##Usage
Clone the repository:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory-partitioning-scheduling.git
cd memory-partitioning-scheduling
```
Run the script:
```
python scheduler.py
```
Follow the prompts:
Enter the total memory size.
Enter the number of processes.
Enter the memory size and duration time for each process.
Example:
``` 
Enter the total memory size: 7
Enter the number of processes: 5
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 1: 1 2
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 2: 1 3
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 3: 2 1
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 4: 3 1
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 5: 3 4

```

###Code Explanation
```
Partition Class 
class Partition:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.is_free = True
        self.process = None

    def allocate(self, process):
        self.is_free = False
        self.process = process

    def free(self):
        self.is_free = True
        self.process = None

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.size}"
```
Represents a memory partition.
Methods to allocate and free the partition.
```
Process Class
class Process:
    def __init__(self, pid, size, duration):
        self.pid = pid
        self.size = size
        self.duration = duration
```
Represents a process with a process ID, size, and duration.
Creating Partitions
 ```
def create_partitions(memory_size):
    partitions = []
    size = 1
    while memory_size > size:
        partitions.append(Partition(size))
        memory_size -= size
        size *= 2
    partitions.append(Partition(memory_size))
    return sorted(partitions, key=lambda partition: partition.size)
```
Dynamically creates memory partitions based on the given total memory size.
Freeing Partitions
 ```
def free_partition(partition, duration):
    time.sleep(duration)
    partition.free()
```
Frees a partition after a certain duration.
Process Scheduling Methods

### Single Queue
```
def single_queue(partitions, processes):
    queue = processes[:]
    start_time = time.time()

    while queue:
        process = queue.pop(0)
        for partition in partitions:
            if process.size <= partition.size:
                while not partition.is_free:
                    time.sleep(1)
                partition.allocate(process)
                threading.Thread(target=free_partition, args=(partition, process.duration)).start()
                break

    while not all(partition.is_free for partition in partitions):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    end_time = time.time()
    total_time = int(end_time - start_time)
    throughput = f"{len(processes)} / {total_time}" if total_time > 0 else 0
    utilization = int((sum(p.size * p.duration for p in processes) / (memory_size * total_time))*100) if total_time > 0 else 0

    return utilization, throughput
```
Allocates processes to partitions using a single queue.
### Multiple Queue

```
def multiple_queue(partitions, processes):
    queues = [Queue() for _ in partitions]

    for process in processes:
        for i, partition in enumerate(partitions):
            if process.size <= partition.size:
                queues[i].put(process)
                break

    start_time = time.time()
    threads = []
    for i, partition in enumerate(partitions):
        t = threading.Thread(target=process_partition_queue, args=(partition, queues[i]))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()

    for t in threads:
        t.join()

    end_time = time.time()
    total_time = int(end_time - start_time)
    throughput = f"{len(processes)} / {total_time}" if total_time > 0 else 0
    utilization = (sum(p.size * p.duration for p in processes) / (memory_size * total_time)) * 100 if total_time > 0 else 0

    return utilization, throughput
```
Allocates processes to partitions using multiple queues, one for each partition.
Example Output
 ```
-------Partitions size-------
[1, 2, 4]

-------Enter your processes informations-------
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 1: 1 2
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 2: 1 3
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 3: 2 1
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 4: 3 1
Enter the memory size & duration time for process 5: 3 4

-------Running in single queue method-------
